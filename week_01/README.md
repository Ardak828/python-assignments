I took as inspiration the 'Baseline Test' from Blade Runner 2049 (2017 directed by Denis Villeneuve)
\
Original poem is from Vladimir Nabokov's novelÂ 'Pale Fire.'
\
I tried to utilize some repeated words in the test by replacing them with letters. Also tried to use indexing for each word when applicable.
And basic line break and font case.
